## Introduction

Maintaining documentation is a challenging endeavor. Yes, there are VS_Code extensions for Markdown (.md) files. There are site generators for creating documentation. Yet many of these solutions are either time consuming, inflexible, or just all round hard to maintain. This is where SputDoc comes in to play. With our built in admin dashboard and handy CLI tools, you can take any existing codebase and turn it into a self documenting joy to use.
