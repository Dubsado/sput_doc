## Introduction

What does this folder do? Well look no further than this document than to explain it for you, dear. You see, when it comes to accessing files in NodeJs, I am may not be a professional, but I am most certainly proficient.

## Get Files

This was a fun example and exploration to dip my feet back into the async file structure of the NodeJs API. The [getFiles.ts](getFiles.ts) allows the user to access a local directory through a simple API.

You can see corresponding Jests for these functions inside [the /jest folder](../jest/getFiles.test.ts). Through these tests it should be pretty clear that getting files will allow you to include, exclude, or both in combination files from a local file structure.

You can link relatively to files from within a [Github README](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7653483/github-relative-link-in-markdown-file)?
